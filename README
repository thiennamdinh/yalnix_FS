- All the test we used are the folder "tests"
  - not linked to the make file
- We built our own cache rather than import one
  - all related methods are in "cache.c"
  - separate structures/methods for inode and block
- Free blocks/inodes are kept in an array of ints and booted at startup

- Everything *should* be functional
